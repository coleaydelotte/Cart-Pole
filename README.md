# Cart-Pole

This repository contains the implementation of a basic Cart-Pole reinforcement learning (RL) problem using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

The Cart-Pole problem is a classic problem in reinforcement learning where the goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards (positive for balancing the pole, negative for letting it fall) and learns to take actions to stabilize the pole over time.

I am doing this problem because I want to familiarize myself with things like libraries like Keras and Tensorflow

This implementation uses TensorFlow and Keras to train a neural network to solve this problem. The agent interacts with the environment and learns through trial and error to optimize its actions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Gym (for the Cart-Pole environment)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
